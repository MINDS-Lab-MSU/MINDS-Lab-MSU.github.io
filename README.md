# Machine Intelligence and Data Science Lab

Welcome to the MINDS lab at Morgan State University, led by Dr. Jamell Dacon. Our research lies in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, especially in areas of Fairness & Bias in AI/ML/NLP, Human-Computer Interaction, Data Science for Social Good, and AI + X: Education and Healthcare with applications for people with disabilities (PWDs), criminal justice, and more.

<b>Objective</b>: By leveraging advanced machine learning and data mining algorithms, we focus on the analysis, experimental evaluation, design and implementation of theory, logic and systems, with an emphasis on developing explainable, interpretable and theoretically sound tools to create new and innovative technology.
