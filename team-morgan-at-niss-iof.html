          <i>In a pivotal gathering that brought together academia, policy experts, and researchers, a workshop addressing the urgent concern of excessive use of force by police unfolded. Six individuals, including an community-based research-driven professor and five of his fresh and enthusiastic students, immersed themselves in discussions and deliberations on issues that have become central to sociologists, statisticians, policymakers, and the general public. </i>

         <b>Professor Jamell Dacon</b>, an Assistant Professor, who's research spans the areas of Trustworthy AI, Natural Language Processing, Computational Social Science, and Interdisciplinary Data Science. 
         </p>
	 <p>
	  In the heart of academia, a symphony of voices resonated as a professor and five dedicated students from Morgan State Univerity traveled from Baltimore, MD to Carleton College in Northfield, MN 
          to attend the <a href="https://www.niss.org/events/iof-workshop-statistical-challenges-analysis-police-use-force">IOF Workshop: Statistical Challenges in the Analysis of Police Use of Force</a> to confront a burning issue: the excessive use of force by police. 
          This urgent societal concern has not only captured the attention of sociologists, mathematicians, statisticians, policymakers, and the general public but has also become a focal point for those seeking 
          rigorous answers in a sea of complexities.
          As the workshop unfolded, the participants embarked on a collective journey to dissect the intricate challenges surrounding policing data, echoing the urgency of the matter at hand. 
          The issues of data quality, unstructured data processing, tradeoffs between access and privacy, and statistical challenges in fairness analysis emerged as beacons guiding the discussion.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 The workshop was laced with stalwarts in sociological and statistical research and over 100 attendees, bringing a wealth of experience to the table. With a career spanning decades, Dr. <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/annaharvey/">Anna Harvey</a>'s, 
	 (Professor of Politics and founder and Director of the Public Safety Lab at New York University) commitment to unraveling the social intricacies of policing was evident. A seasoned scholar in criminology and social justice, she set the stage for a profound exploration of the challenges ahead.
	 Dr. Harvey was also accompanied by Dr. <a href="https://jacobdkaplan.weebly.com/">Jacob Kaplan</a> (Princeton University) and Dr. <a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/announcement/new-bjs-senior-statistical-advisor-shelley-s-hyland-phd">Shelley S. Hyland</a> (Bureau of Justice Statistics) to
	 discuss Perils and Promises regarding <i>Quality Issues with Aggregate Crime Data</i> accentuating high error rates in FBI Audits and highlighed the 
	 thought of a federal mandate; however, this cannot be executed due to the collection of use-of-force data being voluntary and the 10th amendment which implies that use-of-force data collection cannot be federally mandated.
	 </p>
	 <p>
	 There were five (5) impactful research-centered sessions where 18 distinguished speakers with various backgrounds and academic levels ranging from academic instituions, government agencies and non-profit organizations gathered together in the pursuit of justice confined to the data and white pages of theory rather than the streets where it is most urgently needed.
	 The workshop not only revealed the pressing challenges but also fostered collaborative thinking and proposed actionable steps. Each speaker collectively emphasized the need for transparent methodologies, cross-disciplinary collaborations, and community engagement to ensure the reliability and relevance of research on police use of force.
         </p>
         <p>
	 Professor Dacon set the tone, unveiling the pitfalls of relying on aggregated policing data. His questions to the panelists after each session drew insights that exposed the biases and gaps that compromise the depth of our understanding. 
	 In a world driven by numbers, the workshop attendees grappled with the realization that these very figures might be distorting the reality on the ground. Femi dissected the challenges in fairness analysis, emphasizing the need for nuanced approaches to ensure the integrity of results. The statistics, he argued, must not just be numbers on paper but instruments of truth.
	 Opeyemi brought a new dimension to the conversation. Her exploration of narratives and qualitative data emphasized the potential lying within the stories of those who have experienced police force. The group grappled with the idea that sometimes, it's the stories, not just the statistics, that carry the weight of truth. While conversations continued, both Krystalyn and Jaylin steered discussions through the murky waters of data access and privacy. 
	 Krystalyn indicated that dance between research necessities and ethical responsibilities must be a harmonious dance to emerge as a central theme to solve joint problem of concern by sociologists, statisticians, policymakers, and the general public, while  Jaylin stressed that the power bestowed upon researchers demands a commitment to privacy and justice, a principle that must guide every step.
	 On the other hand, Abdulai shared tales of community-based initiatives. He illustrated how empowering communities to collect and shape data not only ensures relevance but also democratizes the narrative. In this discourse, the group confronted the necessity of amplifying community voices in the pursuit of justice.
	 </p>
	 <h4>Sowing Seeds of Change:</h4>
	 <p>
	 <i>#TeamMorgan</i> found themselves at the nexus of theory and action. Professor Dacon, with the wisdom of outcome disparities in AI technology, acknowledged the significance of these discussions. The workshop, he emphasized, was not just a gathering of minds but a call to arms&mdash;an invitation to confront the shadows and emerge with a brighter understanding.
	 </p>
         <p>
	 The goal of the workshop—to illuminate unique approaches and perspectives—was not only met but surpassed. The participants left with not just a deeper understanding of the challenges but also a roadmap for action. It was a journey that transcended academia, reaching into the very fabric of society where change is most urgently needed.
         </p>
         <p>
	 In the wake of this gathering, these six thinkers, guided by their professor, emerged not just as scholars but as advocates for justice, armed with insights that could shape the narrative of policing reform. The urgency of the excessive use of force by police had found its champions, and the workshop had become a crucible for transformative ideas, sowing seeds of change that would ripple through the realms of academia, policy, and the public consciousness.
	 </p>
	 <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
	 <p>
	As the workshop concluded, Professor Dacon expressed optimism about the potential for meaningful change through collaborative efforts. The diverse perspectives brought to the table by <i>#TeamMorgan</i> laid the foundation for a holistic understanding of the complexities surrounding police use of force. It is through such workshops that multi-disciplinary researchers and policymakers can forge a path forward, armed with innovative methodologies and a shared commitment to social justice.
